* LAN:
Just hit on the LAN Host(H) button and provide to the second player your local IP,
second player should enter your local IP in the LAN Client(C) section.

* Network:
Same as LAN except that you should forwarding port 7777 in your router and provide to the second player your external IP.
Thats it.
